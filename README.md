I _try_ to build durable, practical systems and ship boring software that works.
Currently preparing for the Certified Web Exploitation Specialist (CWES) offered by [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## Focus
- Web security and exploitation practice
- Building small, professional tools that solve real problems
- Turning practical skill into stable, repeatable outcomes

## What I Work With
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,go,ts,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

## What I Value
- Discipline beats mood
- Finishable scope is strength
- Learning only counts when it ships

## Education 
Bachelors in Fine Arts, focus in Drawing and Painting (don't go to art school)
